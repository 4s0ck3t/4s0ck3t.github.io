Welcome [guest].


This will be my sandbox to see what works and what doesn't 

>[!INFO] For example



{: .notice--danger} Something dangerouse

{: .notice--success} Successful?!


**Notice:** This is an important info notice.
{: .notice}

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
